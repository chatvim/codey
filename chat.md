i need your help to build a new i'm calling "codey beaver" it's a command line
tool and typescript node.js library for calling and using LLMs to facilitate
computer programming.

i have created a folder called npm-codeybeaver-cli and in this folder i have a
package.json with the project name @codeybeaver/cli. i have created a file called cdy.ts. it outputs "hello world".

my first question is how to get the command-line arguments and, for now, just print them out.

here is my current code:

```typescript
console.log("hello world");
```
