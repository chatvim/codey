i need your help to build a new i'm calling "codey beaver" it's a command line
tool and typescript node.js library for calling and using LLMs to facilitate
computer programming.

i have created a folder called npm-codeybeaver-cli and in this folder i have a
package.json with the project name @codeybeaver/cli. i have created a file called cdy.ts. it outputs "hello world".

my first question is how to get the command-line arguments and, for now, just print them out.

here is my current code:

```typescript
console.log("hello world");
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

Great start! To access command-line arguments in a Node.js script (including TypeScript), you use `process.argv`. This is an array where:

- `process.argv[0]` is the path to the Node.js executable
- `process.argv[1]` is the path to your script (`cdy.ts` after compilation)
- `process.argv[2]` onwards are the arguments passed by the user

**To simply print the command-line arguments:**  
Update your `cdy.ts`:

```typescript
console.log("hello world");

// Print command line arguments, excluding the first two
const args = process.argv.slice(2);
console.log("Arguments:", args);
```

**Example usage:**  
```sh
node dist/cdy.js foo bar baz
```
Output:
```
hello world
Arguments: [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ]
```

### Tips for CLI Tools

- Consider using a CLI helper like [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) or [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) to manage options as your tool grows.
- If you want `cdy` to run directly (without `node`), add this to the top of your `cdy.ts`:
  ```typescript
  #!/usr/bin/env node
  ```
  (and make it executable: `chmod +x dist/cdy.js` after build)

Let me know if you'd like an example with `commander` or how to set up TypeScript for easy CLI development!

# === USER ===

is there a zod-based tool for handling command-line arguments? my first step is i want to add a command for prompting. the idea is something like this:

```sh
cdy -p "what is 1 + 1?"
```

the output for that from the default llm will then be streamed to the console. however, let's not integrate the llm yet. i just want to handle the command-line arguments.

# === ASSISTANT ===

Great plan! There isn’t an official, all-in-one “zod-based” CLI parser like `commander` for Node.js yet, **but** there are libraries that use [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) (a TypeScript-first schema validation library) to parse and validate CLI arguments. These tools make it easy and type-safe to declare exactly what arguments your CLI expects.

### Option 1: [`zodcli`](https://github.com/patarapolw/zodcli)

- **zodcli** provides a schema-based, declarative way to handle CLI arguments and options.
- It’s new but simple and works well for small CLI apps.

**Install:**

```sh
npm install zod zodcli
```

**Example Usage (`cdy.ts`):**

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { cli } from "zodcli";

const schema = z.object({
  p: z.string().min(1, 'Prompt is required'),
});

const { values, errors } = cli(schema);

if (errors) {
  console.error(errors);
  process.exit(1);
}

console.log("Prompt:", values.p);
```

Now you can run:
```sh
node dist/cdy.js -p "what is 1 + 1?"
```
and get:
```
Prompt: what is 1 + 1?
```

---

### Option 2: Roll your own (with [meow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meow) or [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) + zod)

If you want tighter integration or more advanced features, you can use a popular argument parser and validate the result with Zod:

**Install:**

```sh
npm install meow zod
```

**Example:**

```typescript
import meow from 'meow';
import { z } from 'zod';

const cli = meow(`
  Usage
    $ cdy -p <prompt>
`, {
  flags: {
    p: {
      type: 'string',
      alias: 'prompt',
      isRequired: true
    }
  }
});

const schema = z.object({
  p: z.string().min(1, 'Prompt is required'),
});

const parse = schema.safeParse(cli.flags);

if (!parse.success) {
  console.error(parse.error.format());
  process.exit(1);
}

console.log("Prompt:", parse.data.p);
```

---

### Summary

- **zodcli**: Small, dependency-light, just Zod + arg parsing.
- **meow/yargs + zod**: Robust, lots of features, explicit validation step.

If you want **one file, no boilerplate, Zod-native experience**, try `zodcli`.

# === USER ===

does commander support typescript?

# === ASSISTANT ===

**Yes, [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) (the popular Node.js CLI library) has excellent TypeScript support!**  
You can import it as a module, get full type checking/intellisense, and define your CLI options and commands in a type-safe way.

### How to Use Commander with TypeScript

#### 1. Install

```sh
npm install commander
```

TypeScript type definitions are included with Commander since v7 (no need for `@types/commander`).

#### 2. Simple Example (`cdy.ts`)

```typescript
import { Command } from 'commander';

const program = new Command();

program
  .name('cdy')
  .version('0.1.0')
  .option('-p, --prompt <text>', 'Prompt to send to the LLM');

program.parse();

// Get the parsed options
const options = program.opts();

if (options.prompt) {
  console.log('Prompt:', options.prompt);
} else {
  console.log('No prompt provided.');
}
```

#### 3. Compile and Run

```sh
tsc cdy.ts
node cdy.js -p "What is 1 + 1?"
# Output: Prompt: What is 1 + 1?
```

#### 4. TypeScript Features
- Full autocompletion in editors like VSCode
- Strongly typed options and arguments if you want to extend for richer CLI programs

**Tip:** For more advanced usage and custom command handling, see [Commander’s TypeScript documentation](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/#typescript).

---

**Summary:**  
Commander fully supports TypeScript; just install it and use ES module imports. No extra packages needed!

# === USER ===

i'd like to change the behavior slightly. i want to use git-style command, meaning like this:

```sh
cdy prompt "what is 1 + 1?"
```

each command may then take additional options. how can we make this change?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Great idea! Commander supports **git-style subcommands** ("cdy <command> [options]"). Here’s how you can structure your CLI for this.

---

## Step-by-Step: Git-Style Subcommands with Commander (TypeScript)

### 1. Update your code to define subcommands

```typescript
import { Command } from 'commander';

const program = new Command();

program
  .name('cdy')
  .description('Codey Beaver CLI: An LLM-powered programming assistant')
  .version('0.1.0');

// Define the `prompt` subcommand
program
  .command('prompt <text>')
  .description('Send a prompt to the LLM')
  .option('-m, --model <model>', 'Choose an LLM backend/model')
  .action((text: string, options: { model?: string }) => {
    console.log('Prompt:', text);
    if (options.model) {
      console.log('Model:', options.model);
    }
  });

program.parse();
```

### 2. Usage Example

```sh
cdy prompt "what is 1 + 1?"
# Output: Prompt: what is 1 + 1?

cdy prompt "generate a hello world script" -m gpt-4
# Output: 
# Prompt: generate a hello world script
# Model: gpt-4
```

### 3. Add More Subcommands

Just chain more `.command()` calls for more verbs (like `summarize`, `refactor`, etc).

---

## **Key Points**
- Subcommands are defined with `.command('name <args>')`
- Each subcommand gets its own `.action()` callback.
- Commander automatically handles help output (`cdy --help`).

---

**References:**  
- [Commander docs: Subcommands](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/#subcommands)

---

Let me know if you want to split each subcommand into its own file (good for larger CLIs), or if you need zod integration on top of this!

# === USER ===

right now i have a separate shell script that runs the build node.js file:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
node cdy.js $@
```

taht file is called cdy. it called "node cdy.js ...". is that a good way of doing this? or should i make the built javascript file directly executable?

# === ASSISTANT ===

That’s a great question! Both approaches are common, but there’s a **better, more idiomatic Node.js way** for CLI tools:  
**Make your built JavaScript file directly executable** by adding a [shebang line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) at the top.

---

## How to Make Your Built JS Directly Executable

1. **Add a shebang to the top of your entrypoint TypeScript file:**
   
   At the top of `cdy.ts`, add:
   ```typescript
   #!/usr/bin/env node
   ```
   (It’s important that this is the absolute first line—no blank lines or comments before it!)

2. **Build/compile as normal:**  
   When using `tsc`, the shebang line is preserved in the output JS file (`cdy.js`).

3. **Set the executable bit:**
   ```sh
   chmod +x dist/cdy.js
   ```

4. **Run directly:**
   ```sh
   ./dist/cdy.js prompt "what is 1 + 1?"
   ```

You no longer need a shell wrapper script. You can also set up an npm CLI binary in your `package.json` (see below).

---

## Bonus: Distribute as an `npm` CLI Tool

If you want users to be able to do `npx @codeybeaver/cli` or run `cdy` after installing globally, add this to your `package.json`:

```json
"bin": {
  "cdy": "./dist/cdy.js"
}
```

Now, after installing globally with `npm install -g .`, users get a `cdy` command.

---

### Why Shebang + Executable Bit is Better Than a Shell Script

- Keeps deployment/distribution simple
- No shell script needed
- Standard for Node.js CLIs (npm, create-react-app, etc.)
- One command to maintain and ship

---

**Summary:**  
Prefer using a shebang line and setting the file executable. Only use a shell script wrapper in exotic scenarios (e.g., needing to set env vars or support multiple platforms with different node paths).

Let me know if you want an end-to-end example or further distribution tips!

# === USER ===

that's fine, however, i don't want ".js" to be in the command when it is installed on the user's device. can that be removed somehow? note that i am building my .ts file to .js using typescript.

# === ASSISTANT ===

Absolutely, you can have users run `cdy` (not `cdy.js`), just like `git` or `npm`! 👍 Here’s how you do that for a Node/TypeScript CLI:

---

## 1. Use the `"bin"` Field in `package.json`

Specify the CLI name (`cdy`) and the path to your **compiled** JavaScript file:

```json
"bin": {
  "cdy": "./dist/cdy.js"
}
```

- When users (or you) install your package globally (`npm install -g .` or as a real published package), npm will create a **symlink** in the user’s `$PATH` pointing from `cdy` (no extension) to your built JS file.

---

## 2. Make Sure the Entrypoint is Executable and Has a Shebang

In your `cdy.ts`, the first line should be:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

When you build with TypeScript, this line will be copied to `dist/cdy.js`.

After building, set the file as executable:

```sh
chmod +x dist/cdy.js
```

---

## 3. Try it Out!

If you install the package globally:

```sh
npm install -g .
```
or run directly with [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx):

```sh
npx @codeybeaver/cli prompt "test"
```
you can simply type:

```sh
cdy prompt "what is 1 + 1?"
```

**No `.js` needed.**

---

## 4. You Do **Not** Need to Rename Files

Don’t rename your built `cdy.js` as just `cdy`. Node CLI convention is:
- Source: `cdy.ts`
- Compiled: `cdy.js`
- User-facing binary: whatever you specify in `"bin"` (usually `cdy`), automatically set up by npm

---

## 5. Final Package.json Example

```json
{
  "name": "@codeybeaver/cli",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "bin": {
    "cdy": "./dist/cdy.js"
  },
  //...other fields...
}
```

---

**Summary:**  
- Put `#!/usr/bin/env node` at the top of your TypeScript file  
- Compile as normal  
- Add `"bin": { "cdy": "./dist/cdy.js" }` to your `package.json`  
- Make sure the JS file is executable  
- Users will just run `cdy`  

Ready for the next step? 🎉

# === USER ===

can this code be made to handle either stdin or command-line arguments? and how should this work? maybe the "prompt" command has optional input on the command-line, and if none is provided, it reads from stdin. is that a good way to handle that? bear in mind i plan to use this with pipes a lot.

# === ASSISTANT ===

**This is an excellent pattern for CLI tools!**  
Most great Unix-style tools work like this:  
- If a positional argument is provided, use it  
- **Else, if no argument is provided, read from stdin (for piping)**

For your `cdy prompt` command, here's how this UX would work:

```sh
cdy prompt "what is 1 + 1?"   # argument used as prompt

echo "give me a JS bubble sort" | cdy prompt   # input read from stdin
```

Let's see a **TypeScript Commander** example that supports both:

---

## Example: Support Both Argument and stdin

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { Command } from "commander";

const program = new Command();

async function readStdin(): Promise<string> {
  const chunks: Buffer[] = [];
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    process.stdin.on('data', chunk => chunks.push(Buffer.from(chunk)));
    process.stdin.on('end', () => resolve(Buffer.concat(chunks).toString('utf8').trim()));
    process.stdin.on('error', reject);
  });
}

program
  .command('prompt [input]')
  .description('Send a prompt to the LLM (from arg or stdin)')
  .action(async (input: string | undefined) => {
    if (input) {
      console.log("Prompt (from arg):", input);
    } else if (!process.stdin.isTTY) {
      // stdin is not a terminal => input is being piped in
      const stdinInput = await readStdin();
      if (stdinInput.length > 0) {
        console.log("Prompt (from stdin):", stdinInput);
      } else {
        console.error("No input provided via stdin or as argument.");
        process.exit(1);
      }
    } else {
      // No input at all
      console.error("No prompt input given. Use an argument or pipe input.");
      process.exit(1);
    }
  });

program.parse();
```

---

## How This Works

- If you pass an argument (`cdy prompt "foo"`), it uses that.
- If you do **not** pass an argument and input is **piped** (`echo bar | cdy prompt`), it reads from stdin.
- If you run `cdy prompt` with **no** input, it errors with a helpful message.

---

## Helpful UX: Show a Help Message

For piped usage, you may want to output help if _really nothing_ is provided.

---

## This is the canonical way for pipe-friendly CLIs

- Many tools (like `cat`, `grep`, `jq`, etc) operate this way.
- It is **friendly for piping** and always gives the user a fallback.

---

**Let me know if you want to add multi-line stdin support, prompt for input interactively, or auto-detect input types!**

# === USER ===

i don't know if that works with commander. it seems to require that i input something on the command-line. maybe we should just make a separate command, "cdy stdin"?

# === ASSISTANT ===

**Great question!**  
This pattern absolutely does work with Commander when set up properly, and it’s common for modern CLI tools to *fall back* to reading stdin if no argument is given.

### What Actually Happens
- If you declare a positional argument as **optional** (in Commander: `[input]`), then it's not required to supply it on the command-line; you can invoke `cdy prompt` with nothing and Commander will happily allow it.
- Your action gets called with `input` set to `undefined`. From there, you can check if input is being piped (`process.stdin.isTTY === false`) and read from stdin.

### **Demonstration**

Here's a working TypeScript/Commander example that behaves this way:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { Command } from 'commander';

const program = new Command();

function readStdin(): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let data = '';
    process.stdin.setEncoding('utf8');
    process.stdin.on('data', chunk => data += chunk);
    process.stdin.on('end', () => resolve(data.trim()));
    process.stdin.on('error', reject);
  });
}

program
  .command('prompt [input]')
  .description('Send a prompt to the LLM (via argument or stdin)')
  .action(async (input: string | undefined) => {
    if (input) {
      console.log('Prompt from argument:', input);
    } else if (!process.stdin.isTTY) {
      const stdinInput = await readStdin();
      if (stdinInput) {
        console.log('Prompt from stdin:', stdinInput);
      } else {
        console.error('No prompt given through argument or stdin.');
        process.exit(1);
      }
    } else {
      console.error('No prompt given through argument or stdin.');
      process.exit(1);
    }
  });

program.parse(process.argv);
```

### **Usage Demonstration**

```sh
cdy prompt "hello"
# Output: Prompt from argument: hello

echo "hello" | cdy prompt
# Output: Prompt from stdin: hello

cdy prompt
# Output: No prompt given through argument or stdin.
```

> **It works!**  
> This pattern is robust and idiomatic for a CLI in Node/TypeScript (with Commander).

---

### **Should You Make a Separate `cdy stdin` Command?**

**You don’t need to, unless you want a different behavior for piped input.**
- Tools like `cat`, `jq`, etc. don't require separate subcommands for piped input vs argument input.
- Users naturally expect a CLI to fall back gracefully to stdin.

---

### **Summary**

- Yes, Commander supports optional positional arguments (`[input]`) and can work exactly as you want.
- Don’t split into a `stdin` subcommand unless you’re offering *completely different* behavior/modes.
- The typical Unix/philosophy is "argument if present, otherwise stdin if piped", and users will love that!

# === USER ===

great, now, i want to make a convenience method "cdyp" that is also globally available. basically, because i plan to type this a lot, "cdy prompt" is a big long. i want "cdyp" to be a shortcut for "cdy prompt". how can i do this? i want to keep the same functionality, but just have a shorter command. i also want to make sure that this is available globally when the package is installed.

# === ASSISTANT ===

Excellent idea! This is a great use of npm's **bin aliases**—you can make multiple commands point to the same entrypoint.

# How To: Make `cdyp` Alias for `cdy prompt`

## 1. Add `cdyp` to the `"bin"` field in `package.json`

Your `"bin"` section should look like:

```json
"bin": {
  "cdy": "./dist/cdy.js",
  "cdyp": "./dist/cdyp.js"
}
```

> **Notice:** Each key creates a global binary with that name.

## 2. Create a Thin Wrapper for `cdyp`

You'll want `./dist/cdyp.js` to exist as an executable file. The easiest way (without weird symlinks) is to create a tiny TypeScript file that just invokes your CLI with `prompt` as the first argument.

**In your `src` (or wherever your source is):**

### `cdyp.ts`:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node
// This is the launcher for the "cdyp" alias

// Insert "prompt" as the first argument after the node and script paths
const args = process.argv.slice(0, 2).concat('prompt', process.argv.slice(2));

require('./cdy.js'); // ← Path to your main built script
```

- On build, this creates `dist/cdyp.js`.

**Or, in TypeScript:**
```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node
// src/cdyp.ts

process.argv.splice(2, 0, 'prompt');
require('./cdy');
```

## 3. Build Your Project

You must make sure your tool builds both `cdy.js` and `cdyp.js` in your dist output.

## 4. Make Both Files Executable

```sh
chmod +x dist/cdy.js dist/cdyp.js
```

## 5. Result

- `cdy prompt "foo"` and `cdyp "foo"` will do the same thing globally.
- You can distribute both with npm by publishing.

---

## **Bonus:** Making the Alias Even Simpler (Single File)

If it suits you, you can make `cdy.js` check `process.argv[1]` (the filename), and if it was invoked as `cdyp`, it can inject `'prompt'` into the argument list.  
**However, the two-file solution (above) is generally clearer and more manageable for npm CLI tools.**

---

## **Summary Table**

| Command | Does                 |
|---------|----------------------|
| `cdy prompt ...` | Normal usage     |
| `cdyp ...`       | Shortcut for `cdy prompt ...` |

---

Let me know if you need help adapting this for TypeScript build pipelines or want a more advanced alias system!

# === USER ===

can i just use sh? something like this:

cdyp:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
node cdy.js prompt $@
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

**Yes, you absolutely can!**  
A simple shell wrapper is a totally fine approach and works well for small projects.

Here’s how you’d do it:

---

## 1. Add this `cdyp` shell script to your package’s `bin` directory (or wherever you build your outputs):

**cdyp:**
```sh
#!/bin/sh
node cdy.js prompt "$@"
```
Or, if your built file is in a `dist` directory:
```sh
#!/bin/sh
node dist/cdy.js prompt "$@"
```

## 2. Make Sure It’s Executable

```sh
chmod +x cdyp
```
(or `chmod +x dist/cdyp` after moving/building it there)

## 3. Add to `package.json`

In your `package.json`:
```json
"bin": {
  "cdy": "./dist/cdy.js",
  "cdyp": "./dist/cdyp"
}
```

## 4. On Global Install…

When installed globally via `npm install -g .`, users will have both `cdy` and `cdyp` available in their PATH, and `cdyp ...` will actually run `cdy prompt ...`.

---

### **Caveats**
- If your package is cross-platform and needs to support Windows natively, note that `sh` scripts may not work out-of-the-box in Windows CMD or PowerShell (but work fine in WSL, Git Bash, etc).  
- If you want full cross-platform support, the Node launcher approach shown earlier is better.
- For personal/team use or Unix-first tools, a shell script is perfectly fine.

---

### **Summary**
- Yes, using a small shell script as an alias for a subcommand is common, simple, and effective!
- Just make sure the path to `cdy.js` is correct relative to wherever `cdyp` will be.

Let me know if you want a fully cross-platform solution, or just want to stick with the shell! If so, you're good to go 🚀

# === USER ===

this version works:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
node cdy.js prompt "$@"
```

is there any way to make this so that all strings passed to cdyp are concattnated, with whitspaces, and sent to "cdy prompt"? what i mean is like this:

```
cdyp this is my prompt
```

instead of

```
cdyp "this is my prompt"
```     

can this be done in the shell script?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Great question!  
You can absolutely concatenate all arguments into a single string in your shell script and pass that as a single prompt to `cdy.js prompt`.

Here’s how you do it:

---

### Option 1: The Quick Solution (Shell Script)

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# Join all arguments into a single string
prompt="$*"
node cdy.js prompt "$prompt"
```

**How it works:**  
- `$*` joins all arguments into a single string (separated by spaces).
- `node cdy.js prompt "$prompt"` passes that as a single argument.

**Usage:**
```
cdyp this is my prompt
```
-- becomes -->
```
node cdy.js prompt "this is my prompt"
```

---

### Option 2: Robust (handles pesky edge cases, like leading/trailing whitespace)

```sh
#!/bin/sh
prompt="$*"
# Optionally strip leading/trailing whitespace (remove if not desired)
prompt=$(printf '%s' "$prompt" | sed 's/^ *//;s/ *$//')
node cdy.js prompt "$prompt"
```

---

**No need for quotes anymore** when using `cdyp`!

- `cdyp this is my prompt` → `"this is my prompt"`
- `cdyp hello world` → `"hello world"`

---

**This will not break your previous usage:**  
Quoting is still supported (the shell will just treat it as one argument to concatenate with any others).

---

**Summary:**  
- Use `$*` to concatenate all arguments with spaces.
- Pass as `node cdy.js prompt "$prompt"`.

Let me know if you want to do this with a Node wrapper instead!

# === USER ===

i've renamed the package to "codeybeaver".

can you please produce a README.md file that gives installation instructions for this package using npm, and usage instructions for the commands "cdy" and "cdyp"?
