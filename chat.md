i need your help to build a new i'm calling "codey beaver" it's a command line
tool and typescript node.js library for calling and using LLMs to facilitate
computer programming.

i have created a folder called npm-codeybeaver-cli and in this folder i have a
package.json with the project name @codeybeaver/cli. i have created a file called cdy.ts. it outputs "hello world".

my first question is how to get the command-line arguments and, for now, just print them out.

here is my current code:

```typescript
console.log("hello world");
```

Great start! To access command-line arguments in a Node.js script (including TypeScript), you use `process.argv`. This is an array where:

- `process.argv[0]` is the path to the Node.js executable
- `process.argv[1]` is the path to your script (`cdy.ts` after compilation)
- `process.argv[2]` onwards are the arguments passed by the user

**To simply print the command-line arguments:**  
Update your `cdy.ts`:

```typescript
console.log("hello world");

// Print command line arguments, excluding the first two
const args = process.argv.slice(2);
console.log("Arguments:", args);
```

**Example usage:**  
```sh
node dist/cdy.js foo bar baz
```
Output:
```
hello world
Arguments: [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ]
```

### Tips for CLI Tools

- Consider using a CLI helper like [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) or [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) to manage options as your tool grows.
- If you want `cdy` to run directly (without `node`), add this to the top of your `cdy.ts`:
  ```typescript
  #!/usr/bin/env node
  ```
  (and make it executable: `chmod +x dist/cdy.js` after build)

Let me know if you'd like an example with `commander` or how to set up TypeScript for easy CLI development!

is there a zod-based tool for handling command-line arguments? my first step is i want to add a command for prompting. the idea is something like this:

```sh
cdy -p "what is 1 + 1?"
```

the output for that from the default llm will then be streamed to the console. however, let's not integrate the llm yet. i just want to handle the command-line arguments.

Great plan! There isn’t an official, all-in-one “zod-based” CLI parser like `commander` for Node.js yet, **but** there are libraries that use [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) (a TypeScript-first schema validation library) to parse and validate CLI arguments. These tools make it easy and type-safe to declare exactly what arguments your CLI expects.

### Option 1: [`zodcli`](https://github.com/patarapolw/zodcli)

- **zodcli** provides a schema-based, declarative way to handle CLI arguments and options.
- It’s new but simple and works well for small CLI apps.

**Install:**

```sh
npm install zod zodcli
```

**Example Usage (`cdy.ts`):**

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { cli } from "zodcli";

const schema = z.object({
  p: z.string().min(1, 'Prompt is required'),
});

const { values, errors } = cli(schema);

if (errors) {
  console.error(errors);
  process.exit(1);
}

console.log("Prompt:", values.p);
```

Now you can run:
```sh
node dist/cdy.js -p "what is 1 + 1?"
```
and get:
```
Prompt: what is 1 + 1?
```

### Option 2: Roll your own (with [meow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meow) or [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) + zod)

If you want tighter integration or more advanced features, you can use a popular argument parser and validate the result with Zod:

**Install:**

```sh
npm install meow zod
```

**Example:**

```typescript
import meow from 'meow';
import { z } from 'zod';

const cli = meow(`
  Usage
    $ cdy -p <prompt>
`, {
  flags: {
    p: {
      type: 'string',
      alias: 'prompt',
      isRequired: true
    }
  }
});

const schema = z.object({
  p: z.string().min(1, 'Prompt is required'),
});

const parse = schema.safeParse(cli.flags);

if (!parse.success) {
  console.error(parse.error.format());
  process.exit(1);
}

console.log("Prompt:", parse.data.p);
```

---

### Summary

- **zodcli**: Small, dependency-light, just Zod + arg parsing.
- **meow/yargs + zod**: Robust, lots of features, explicit validation step.

If you want **one file, no boilerplate, Zod-native experience**, try `zodcli`.

does commander support typescript?
